# <center>SEBC Courseware

This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp (SEBC). Each student is added as a collaborator
on their first day of attendance. Once student evaluations are
processed, all collaborators are removed to prevent changes that
could result in lost work.

Consider forking this repository and cloning it immediately. If
you'd like to propose a change upstream, please consult with your
instructor(s).

You'll be asked to use your clone as a workbook, either by answering
questions inline to the text or adding files that demonstrate your
work.  With proper use of Git and GitHub tools, you can determine
which materials are made visible, and which remain private. The
class will include basic Git instructions, such as using branches,
to control the work you expose.

When the course is completed, your repo effectively stands as a
your record of completed assignments, warts and all! You'll be able
to review your work once class is done, repeat assignments if you
wish, replace ok links with better links, you name it! Think of
this material as a base for your own ongoing self-guided education.
