# <center>SEBC Courseware

This is the courseware for Cloudera's Services Enablement Boot Camp
(SEBC). It is maintained in a private repository. Each student is
made a collaborator on their first day of attendance.

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. To complete exercises
in this course, create branches in your fork and commit changes
them as directed. When the course is complete, your repo is both
your record of completed assignments. Properly handled, your repo
can become a run book you keep and improve as time goes on.
