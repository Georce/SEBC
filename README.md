# <center>SEBC Courseware

This private repository holds the courseware for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp (SEBC). Each student is made a collaborator
on their first day of attendance. Once student evaluations are
processed, all collaborators are removed to prevent actions on the
repository that could result in lost work.

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to a
local system. It's probablt easiest to read the materials, which are written 
in Markdown, from GitHub's UI.

As you complete exercises in this course, create branches
in git and add your results or answers directly to the material.
Commit changes to the branch as needed. When the course is
complete, your repo becomes your record of completed assignments.
Properly handled, your repo can also be treeated as run book you
keep and improve as time goes on.
