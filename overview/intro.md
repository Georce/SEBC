    * For fundamental vocabulary and practices
* Have installed CDH on multi-node clusters before
    * Experience with a distributed application environment
* Can complete labs by objective without step-by-step scripts
    * We focus on practicing skills and finding flaws in documentation
* Know Linux and its common CLI tools well
    * These labs have eaten and will eat non-technical attendees
