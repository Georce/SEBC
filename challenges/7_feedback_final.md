<strong>Was this boot camp useful, difficult, challenging? How so?</strong>  
All of the above. I feel like I have a much stronger base from which to troubleshoot issues after struggling  
through the issues that I have encountered here and discussing solutions with classmates and why they work.    
Certainly difficult, as I came in fresher than I probably should have.  
  
<strong>Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?</strong>  
MySQL administration. The bulk of my blockers came from MySQL. After seeing it on the prerequisites,  
I installed it on an instance for practice. The most familiar topic was probably Kerberos. I had   
Kerberized a couple clusters previously.   
  
<strong>What topic did you enjoy the most? Which topic was least helpful to you?</strong>  
Not exactly a topic, but I really enjoyed hearing insights about customer expectations from your engagements.   
Besides that, ensuring security on a cluster, like adding TLS before Kerberos to ensure that you aren't setting  
it up in the open, was very interesting.  
  
<strong>How long do you need to prepare for a solo installation engagement?</strong>  
Unclear. I have had limited experience on any engagement yet, so I would be guessing blindly at any  
date.
